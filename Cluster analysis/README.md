# Cluster anlaysis
### Cluster analysis is a technique used in data science to group similar data points together based on specific characteristics.

🅰️ In this project, I performed cluster analysis on a dataset related to telecommunication data using the KMeans algorithm from the Scikit-Learn library.
The purpose of this analysis is to identify groups of customers with similar characteristics, which can help businesses to better understand their customers and target them more effectively.

## Programming : Python 🐍 , Jupyter notebook 👩‍💻
- I used various Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib for data manipulation, visualization, and analysis.


### Approach:
- T also used the StandardScaler module from Scikit-Learn to scale the data to have zero mean and unit variance, the LabelEncoder module to encode categorical features as integers, and the silhouette_score function to evaluate the quality of clusters based on their cohesion and separation.
The cluster analysis results and insights can be found in the accompanying Jupyter Notebook file named "Cluster analysis of telco_data.ipynb".

## 📊 Tableau Dashboard
In addition to the cluster analysis, I also created a Tableau dashboard to visualize customer churn and revenue at risk for a telecommunication company. The dashboard provides an interactive view of customer metrics such as monthly revenue, contract type, and customer tenure. The purpose of the dashboard is to provide insights to the company on areas that require attention in order to minimize churn and maximize revenue.

### Methodology
- I used Tableau software to create the interactive dashboard.
- I integrated data from the telecommunication dataset used in the cluster analysis.

## Viz
- The resulting Tableau dashboard can be found at the following link: . The dashboard provides insights into customer churn and revenue at risk for the company and can be used to inform decision-making and strategies to improve customer retention and revenue growth.
